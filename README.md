Project Title: Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

Objective:
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
It demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, regression analysis, model evaluation, and visualization.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pickle
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Data Format: CSV file containing Years of Experience and Salary.


Dataset:
The dataset consists of two columns:
YearsExperience: The number of years an employee has worked.
Salary: The corresponding salary for the given experience.


Key Outputs:
R² Score: Indicates the model’s accuracy in explaining the data.
Weight and Bias: Provide insight into the salary trend based on years of experience.
Predictions: Model-generated salary predictions for new inputs.


Visualization:
Regression Line on Training Data:
Depicts the relationship between years of experience and salary.
Actual vs Predicted Values:
Demonstrates the model's performance on unseen data.
